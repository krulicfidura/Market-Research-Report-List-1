<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Splice Closures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dome Type</li><li>Horizontal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber splice closures are essential components in fiber optic networks, designed to protect and manage spliced fibers. The market for these closures is primarily categorized into two types: dome type and horizontal type. Dome-type closures are typically used for aerial and underground installations, offering ample space for fiber splicing and excellent environmental protection. In contrast, horizontal-type closures are compact and suited for overcrowded or limited-space environments, making them ideal for outdoor and indoor applications. Both types ensure reliable performance and network integrity.</p></p>
