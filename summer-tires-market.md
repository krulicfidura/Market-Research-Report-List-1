<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Summer Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inner Tube</li><li>Tubeless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The summer tire market features two main types: inner tube and tubeless tires. Inner tube tires consist of a separate inner tube that holds air, offering ease of repair but generally less performance and responsiveness. Tubeless tires, on the other hand, are designed to fit directly onto the rim without an inner tube, providing better handling, reduced weight, and less risk of punctures. The tubeless market is increasingly favored for its advanced technology and improved driving capabilities in warm weather conditions.</p></p>
