<p><strong>The ER Targeted Drugs for Breast Cancer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tamoxifen</li><li>Toremifene</li><li>Fulvestrant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ER-targeted drugs for breast cancer, including Tamoxifen, Toremifene, and Fulvestrant, focus on estrogen receptor modulation to treat hormone-sensitive tumors. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that blocks estrogen's effects, commonly used in early and metastatic cancer. Toremifene also functions as a SERM, effective for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant, an estrogen receptor downregulator, works by degrading the receptor and is utilized for hormone-resistant cases. These therapies aim to slow tumor growth and improve survival rates.</p></p>
